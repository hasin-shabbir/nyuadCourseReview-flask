# Flask-MongoDB Web App

## Title: [NYUAD Course Review](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~mhs581/web-app-do-chussar/flask.cgi/)

## Description
The application makes use of the Python-based micro web framework Flask and Jinja2, in addition to PyMongo for CRUD operations on a MongoDB database for storage and retrieval of relevant information. This web app allows users to access reviews of courses available in NYU Abu Dhabi. The users can search through all the available courses and filter them according to categories, levels, and keywords.
Further, for each course, users can create their accounts after which they will be able to post reviews, edit their reviews, and delete their reviews.

Only one review per course may be posted by a user. However, there is no limit to the number of edits that can be made by a user. Validation checks ensure that course review metric ratings that are input are valid.

For developmental purposes, sample data has only been added to the first listed course. However, the functionality will remain the same on any course selected.

Note: To be redirected to a course's review page, the course title text must be clicked.


The project has great scope and provides a very in-demand application to the students of NYUAD.

The application is deployed [here](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~mhs581/web-app-do-chussar/flask.cgi/).
Update as of 01/01/2022: The application has been removed from deployment servers temporarily.
